## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If "Add to Cart" button doesn't work:
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console)
2. Click "Add to Cart" again
3. Look for errors (red text)
4. Check Network tab (F12 → Network) for API calls

### If Cart is empty after adding:
1. Check localStorage (F12 → Application → Local Storage)
2. Look for 'cart' and 'cartRestaurant' entries
3. If missing, cart context might not be working

### If Checkout button is disabled:
1. Make sure cart has items
2. Check if restaurant data is loaded
3. Look for error messages in red

### If "Place Order" fails:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify you're logged in as USER (not restaurant)
3. Check Network tab for 401/403 errors
4. Verify shipping address is filled

## 🔍 Debug Steps

**Open Browser Console (F12 → Console) and look for:**

When adding to cart:
```
✅ "Item added to cart" toast
✅ No red error messages
```

When clicking checkout:
```
=== CHECKOUT DEBUG ===
Cart: [array of items]
Restaurant: {restaurant object}
Form data: {shipping address, payment method}
```

When placing order:
```
Sending order data: {...}
Order placed successfully: {...}
```

## ✅ What Should Work

1. **Add items to cart**: ✅ Backend tested
2. **View cart**: ✅ Frontend exists
3. **Proceed to checkout**: ✅ Navigation works
4. **Place order**: ✅ Backend endpoint confirmed working (201 Created)
5. **View orders**: ✅ Endpoint exists

## 🎯 If Still Not Working

**Share with me:**
1. Screenshot of what you see
2. Browser console errors (F12 → Console)
3. Network errors (F12 → Network → look for red failed requests)
4. Which step fails (adding to cart, checkout, or placing order?)

The backend is 100% working - I tested it directly. The issue is likely:
- Frontend button not clickable (CSS issue)
- JavaScript error preventing action
- Not logged in with correct user role
- Cart context not loading

Try the debugging steps above and let me know what you find!
